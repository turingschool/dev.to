# Turing mod4 brownfield Dev.to Group Project üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
<i>a challenge to implement new features into an existing, open-source codebase</i>

#### Introduction

This was our first project (team of 3) in mod4 at Turing School of Software and Design. The challenge was to familiarize ourselves with a pre-existing codebase and implement a new features into the web app. The backend of the app is built with `Ruby on Rails` and the frontend is built with `Preact`. For our team, this was the first time we had explored a web app that included code for the FE and BE. We had to work together leveraging our specialized skills pertaining to either Ruby/Rails or JavaScript to create the final product. Each piece of additional functionality is thoroughly tested on the BE using `RSpec`/`Capybara` and the FE using `Jest`/`Enzyme`.

#### Project Goal / User Story (Artisanal Collections Track)
I don‚Äôt have time and energy to read these articles every day, but I‚Äôd like to catch up with the best recent content.

Thankfully, I have you. And you love cultivating content. You login to the app and create a new ‚Äúcollection‚Äù with a name like ‚ÄúBest JS of February‚Äù. Now when you are reading articles in the app there is a [+] button that, when clicked, gives you the option to add that article to a collection.

The collection has a publicly-sharable URL, so that you can tweet it out, I can click the link, and see a listing page of all the articles in the collection.

#### What We Accomplished

Our team was able to successfully complete all functionality required for our specific track. Below are details about each piece that functionality.

- A drop-down menu was created for each article for a logged-in user's news feed. This menu contains a list of each collection that user has created.

- If a user has not yet created any collections, a "Default Collection" if created upon clicking the `SAVE` button.

- When a user clicks the `SAVE` button on an article, that article is saved to the currently selected collection in the drop-down menu of that article.

- If a user clicks their avatar icon in the top right of the screen, a drop-down menu appears that includes a "Collections" button we created.

- Upon selecting the "Collections" button, a user is redirected to a new page displaying all of the collections that user has created, as well as a form to create a new collection. If that user is not currently logged in, they will see a message directing them to login in order to view collections.

- From the Collections view, a user can click on a specific collection they have created to be redirected to a new page displaying links to all the articles within that collection.

- The URL for this page is unique to each collection. This allows a user to share this URL with another user, enabling them to share their collection containing a list of articles associated with it.

- The listed articles within a collection are displayed as links. When any of these links are clicked, the user will be redirected to the full page of that article.
